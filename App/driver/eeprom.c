/* DEAD CODE / NOT BUILT: this file is not listed in App/CMakeLists.txt and is

 * chip, from the original DP32G030-based hardware this fork no longer
 * targets. The active implementation of the EEPROM_ReadBuffer/WriteBuffer
 * interface declared in driver/eeprom.h is driver/eeprom_compat.c, which is
 * backed by the SPI NOR flash driver (driver/py25q16.c) on this fork's
 * PY32F071-based hardware. Kept only for historical reference. */
