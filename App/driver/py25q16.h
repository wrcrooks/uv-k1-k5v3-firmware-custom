 * Multiboot per-bank config banking.
 *
 * Each firmware slot gets its own config bank by default (memory channels,
 * names, VFOs, settings), though SetCfg can point the running firmware at a
 * different bank. A non-zero bank base transparently shifts every flash access
 * BELOW PY25Q16_BANK_SHARED_FROM into the active bank; calibration, boot logo,
 * firmware slots and the multiboot marker all live at/above that boundary and
 * stay shared across every bank.
 *
 * This is the single choke point: both the EEPROM emulation (eeprom_compat.c)
 * and the firmware's direct config reads/writes (settings.c) end up here, so
 * one offset covers them all - no per-call-site patching.
 *
 * Set once at boot, before any settings read, from
 *   PY25Q16_SetBankBase(MB_BankBase(MB_BootResolveState()));
 * and never changed again during a session (a slot restore or SetCfg selection
 * records the next bank and resets first), so the banking itself never needs a
 * cache flush. Raw bank erases behind the driver explicitly call
 * PY25Q16_InvalidateCache().
